# qualcul: A Quantum computer and circuit simulator

_Note: This was made as a fun project to get better at quantum computing since it is a course I am taking in my master's degree. It is very likely that there are better projects out there if you want to use it._

## Features

- Operations such as quantum gates, measures, and interactions with classical bits.
- API to build quantum circuits.
- Simulations using a state vector.
- GPU-accelerated computations if desired.
